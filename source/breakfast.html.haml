      %li Beat the eggs and season with pepper.
      %li Pour the eggs into the empty side of the skillet and let stand for about 30 seconds before carefully stirring. Continue to cook over medium heat until the eggs are almost set.

    %p <strong>Taco Fun Fact:</strong> <em>The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla.</em> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco#Puffy_tacos.2C_taco_kits.2C_breakfast_tacos_and_tacodillas">Wikipedia</a>
    %p Tacos have long been a staple of lunch and dinners across the globe. They are far from conventional with flour tortillas and non-traditional ingredients. When it comes to the <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/most-important-taco-day">most important meal of the day</a>, it was time for tacos to take their place in the spotlight.
    %p <a href="http://www.zagat.com/b/austin/tastiest-breakfast-tacos-in-austin">Austin, Texas</a> has first-mover advantage in the breakfast taco scene. Although the origin story is long enough <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1626190496/">to fill a book</a>, the revolution began in the early 80's at Tamale House on Airport Road, Las Manitas on Congress, and a handful of select commercial locations.
