  %h3.h2 History
  %p In 2013 the happiest accident led to the founding of <strong>#tacoweek</strong>, you see I take pride in making the best tacos imaginable. That's why I was planning on taking <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/melissa-darabian/pork-carnitas-recipe.html">signature slow-cooked carnitas</a> to a friend's pre-Thanksgiving party here in San Francisco. The four pounds of prime pork shoulder were artisanally crafted for maximum softness in a top secret two day process.
  %p When I arrived at the party, the bad news was dealt; &#8220;This is a strictly Kosher party. You'll have to take those home&#8221;. It turned out that price of my Facebook absitenence was missing crucial party details. So I took the carnitas home and quite enjoyed myself surrounded by friendship and a feast of foods outlined in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut">kashrut</a>. 
  %p.m0 Upon arriving home, the challenge had been set before me. These perfect carnitas couldn't go to waste. They would need to be creatively remixed into breakfast, lunch, and dinner tacos. One man, seven days of a strictly taco diet. Thus <strong>#tacoweek</strong> was born.
