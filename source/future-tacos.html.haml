  %h3.h2 Just getting started
  %p Already in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8sZ1DWsAHE">twenty-first</a> century, we've seen tremendous progress in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT46FV64dr8">taco technology</a>. Today, we celebrate those fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDk5ajNDgZc">scientific minds</a>. To be honest though, we could have already reached the pinnacle thanks to the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3008346/deep-inside-taco-bells-doritos-locos-taco">Doritos Locos Taco</a>.
  %p <strong>Taco Fun Fact:</strong> <em>Doritos were invented at Disneyland. The original product was made at the Casa de Fritos at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Using surplus tortillas, the company-owned restaurant cut them up and fried them (as in traditional Mexican chips called totopos) and added basic seasoning, resembling the Mexican chilaquiles, but in this case being dry.</em> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorito">Wikipedia</a>
  %p <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/movie-sci-fi-misc-VP6cEoP5zmzII/fullscreen">Drones</a> have been put into production specifically for local <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1rZBxn3Zx8">taco</a> delivery thanks to <a href="http://tacocopter.com/">Taco Copter</a>. We're moving towards a post-textual society with the release of the <a href="http://xoxco.com/x/tacos/">Taco Text</a> app. Tacos have even been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWT-DJNSxtg">made in space</a>. What have you done lately for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms5d9RN0WzY">scientific taco community</a>?
  %p Our future looks bright, we've already avoided the <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/DN1Zy64Ohmn28/fullscreen">Tacopalypse</a>. Now all we need is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjF032TDDQ">Taco Bot 3000</a> so it can rain tacos.
  %h3.h2 Taco Town
  %p One possible avenue for innovation is <em>layering</em>. As pioneered by Taco Town, there's unlimited combinations for glory. Just as spicy as some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k64w3354kE">taco flavored kisses</a>.
